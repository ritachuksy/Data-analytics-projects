## Dataset

### Medical Appointment Dataset Analysis (noshowappointment)
In this project I analyzed Medical Appointment **No Shows Dataset** using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and communicated my findings with Matplotlib and seaborn. The dataset contained approximatly 111k appointments,

## Summary Of Findings
In this analysis I explored the independent vaiables against the dependent variable. During my exploration I discovered that gender has no effect on the no show variable. About 20% of the patients didn't show up for their appointments while about 80% asummed showing up. SMS_received variable has the highest correlation on the chart but needed more data for more exploration. Furthermore, there was no direct correlation among most of the independent variables and with the no-show variable. Even patients with scholarship missed their apointment with about 4% margin than patients without scholarship. On average, 20% of appointments were missed. Patients with health conditions are likely to turn up for their appointment.
**Out of 38685 appointments made by males, 7723 were missed with the ratio of 20%. Out of 71831 appointments made by females, 14588 were missed with the ratio of 20%.

## Key Insights for Presentation
During this data exploration I focused mainly on finding the main factors that influences the patients posibility of missing their medical appointment and the correlation between the independent varibles and the dependent variable.
